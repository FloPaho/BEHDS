## 1: Project Data

-   Here we follow the steps described in Set up.
-   We create our Project Folder and copy and paste both `template.xlsx` and `template_info.xlsx` into it. As well as rename them correctly.

![Templates1](img/Templates1.PNG) ![Templates2](img/Templates2.PNG)

-   Next we open both these files with our excel and fill in the required data according to our project. In this Example Project we used the Questionnaires "BSI" and "SWLS". We also gathered the demographic information of Age and Sex outside of those Questionnaires, which is why we define those questions here. Take care to read the Headers and fill in Information as required. Here we also indicate the Unit "Years" for "Age" and indicate that in our Project the question of Sex was optional.

##  2: Raw Data

-   Here we follow the steps described in part 4.2. First we again create a Folder `YourProjectName` in rawdata and paste our required data. In this case we create 3 Files. The naming of these files is technically fixed, but it is always good to keep a similar structure.

#### Be sure to follow Step 4.2.2 for filling in the Information in these files.

-   `YourProjectName_raw` for the demographic data collected data of Age and Sex outside of the Questionnaires.

-   `YourProjectName_BSI_1` containing the data of our BSI Questionnaire.

-   `YourProjectName_SWLS_1` containing the data of our SWLS Questionnaire.

## 3: Resources

Next we will have to check the resources folder if there are existing templates of the used Questionnaires. In our case we can see, that only a template for the "SWLS" already exists.

![Resources_Folder](img/Resources_Folder-1.PNG)\#

In the case that your Questionnaires already exists in this folder check if you filled in your rawdata files correctly. Take special care so the column naming matches with yours.

#### 3.1: Creating a Questionnaire

Due to the fact that there is no already existing Questionnaire Template for the "BSI", we will create one ourself. For this we will follow the Steps in 4.3.1. - Open the templates folder and copy `questionnaire_template.xlsx` to your `projectdata` folder. - Rename the file to match your Questionnaire, in this case `BSI.xlsx`. - Open this template and you will see something like this: ![alt text](img/template-1.PNG) - Here we will have to fill in all the Information we have in our Questionnaire. Carefully read the description of each column header and follow the instructions there. - \#### Make sure to use Itemnames that match with your raw data. \#### - If you do this correctly, the finished file should looking similar to this: ![alt text](img/BSI_cutout-1.PNG)

## 4: Finished Data Structure

The finished data structure now looks as follows:

-   projectdata
    -   YourProjectName
        -   YourProjectName.xlsx
        -   YourProjectName_info.xlsx
        -   BSI.xlsx
-   rawdata
    -   YourProjectName
        -   YourProjectName_BSI_1.xlsx
        -   YourProjectName_raw.xlsx
        -   YourProjectName_SWLS_1.xlsx
-   resources
    -   ...
    -   ...
    -   SWLS.xlsx
    -   ...

# 5: Run BEHDS.R

1.  Open `behds.R` in RStudio. `behds.R` can be found in your `BEHDS 0.3.5` root folder.
2.  In the second line of code, enter your project name:
    -   e.g., `proj = "YourProjectName"`
3.  Press the `Source` button on the upper right side of the code window.
4.  Wait for the process to finish; this could take some time.
5.  You can find the converted BIDS structure in `bids/YourProjectName/rawdata`.
6.  You can find the feedback file `YourProjectName.html` in `bids/YourProjectName/derivatives` as well as the finished `.csv` files.
