Currently, a significant gap exists in tools that seamlessly convert behavioral questionnaire data into a widely accepted format. Our custom program bridges this gap by offering a streamlined solution for converting varied behavioral data into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. This conversion is pivotal for researchers and students who work with behavioral data, as it not only enhances data organization and accessibility but also ensures compliance with the growing standards of neuroimaging data analysis. The adoption of BIDS for behavioral data allows for greater integration with neuroimaging datasets, opening avenues for comprehensive multimodal analyses. As no such programs are widely available, our tool represents a significant advancement in the field, offering an intuitive, efficient pathway to standardization that is crucial for advancing research and facilitating collaborations across institutions."
